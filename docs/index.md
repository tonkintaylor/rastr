# rastr

A lightweight geospatial raster datatype library for Python focused on simplicity.

## Overview

`rastr` provides an intuitive interface for creating, reading, manipulating, and exporting geospatial raster data in Python.

### Features

- 🧮 **Complete raster arithmetic**: Full support for mathematical operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) between rasters and scalars.
- 📊 **Flexible visualization**: Built-in plotting with matplotlib and interactive mapping with folium.
- 🗺️ **Geospatial analysis tools**: Contour generation, Gaussian blurring, and spatial sampling.
- 🛠️ **Data manipulation**: Fill NaN values, extrapolate missing data, and resample to different resolutions.
- 🔗 **Seamless integration**: Works with GeoPandas, rasterio, and the broader Python geospatial ecosystem.
- ↔️ **Vector-to-raster workflows**: Convert GeoDataFrame polygons, points, and lines to raster format.
